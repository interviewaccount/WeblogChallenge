This solution uses hadoop streaming, with the python mapreduce framework called
MRJob.

The only requirement is to have the mrjob package installed, which can be done
with:

	sudo pip install mrjob

Running the script locally can be done like so:

	python challenge.py < data/2015_07_22_mktplace_shop_web_log_sample.log  >
		output/question4-most-engaged.txt

The steps() function in challenge.py can be (un)commented out depending on 
which solution / answer you're looking for. This part can be cleaned up 
further or have a script per solution.
