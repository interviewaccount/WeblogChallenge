Question:
IP addresses do not guarantee distinct users, but this is the limitation of the data. As a bonus, consider what additional data would help make better analytical conclusions

Answer:
With the given data, we could leverage User Agent and key on (client_ip, user_agent)
instead of just client_ip which may represent any number of users.

For cleaner data, the website could have a randomly generated session cookie (guid), and we could log cookies in the weblog, and use that to identify unique users, without having to rely on IP address / user agent which may have some overlap.
